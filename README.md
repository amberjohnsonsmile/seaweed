"Umami enters the market as a seaweed-based nutrition bar that enables you to reap the health benefits of seaweed without the briny, fishy taste. Seaweed is a sustainably grown superfood packed with essential vitamins, antioxidants and omega-3s. Featuring whole grains, nuts and dried fruit, this low-sugar bar features an 'umami' taste profile and fusion flavors like apricot-sesame, mango-sriracha and cocoa-chili."
